Small script to download novels from WuxiaWorld.<br>
For now I only tested Genius-Doctor：-Black-Belly-Miss<br>
<br>
Example of usage:<br>
`python main.py "https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Genius-Doctor：-Black-Belly-Miss/all.html"`<br>
<br>
It should create a directory and store the chapters of the novel in separated txt files.

Prerequisites:
WIP
